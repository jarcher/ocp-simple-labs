Exercise 0  - Prerequisites
============================

Welcome to the OpenShift Container Platform  workshop! Throughout this session, you will learn about building, deploying, configuring and being productive with the OpenShift Container Platform to manage containerized applications.

Open up a browser and navigate to the following address:

Once you have successfully authenticated to OpenShift, you will be presented with the OpenShift application catalog.

The catalog streamlines the deployment of applications by providing a user friendly view of the services provided by the platform along with allowing users to build and deploy their own content. We will leverage the catalog later in the lab.
